#Temperature readings, conversion and scrolling functionality added by Beesy

#This script is designed for the following:
#Common cathode or anode 3461 A/B series 4 digit 7 segment displays
#3.3v GPIO pin output, combined with 100R resistors between the segment pins and the GPIO

#The 3461 has a forward voltage of 1.8v and max current of 20mA. 3.3v input with 100R resistors
#gives adequate brightness but limits input current to 15mA to extend the life of the display.

#If you are using as 3461A series common cathode display, alter
#the 'DisplayType' variable below from 'B' to'A' and the relevant mappings
#will be inverted to set the correct GPIO pins to their opposite defaults.

#If you are using 5v GPIO, you must use higher value resistors to prevent over current reaching the LED segments.
#Failure to do so will likely damage your display. Ohms law allows you to calculate the required resistors.

#R = (V(i) - V(f)) / I

#R is the resistor value required.
#V(i) is the input voltage from the GPIO. Raspberry Pi is 3.3v. Arduino breakout boards can be 5v.
#V(f) is the 'forward voltage' of the LED. Refer to the datasheet to confirm. 3461B has a forward voltage of 1.8v
#I is the desired current in Amps. The 3461B has a current tolerance of 20mA (0.02A).
#The configuration described in this script is based upon using 15mA (0.015A) to leave headroom from the maximum.

#If using 5v GPIO, the calculation would be as follows:

#R = (V(i) - V(f)) / I
#R = (5v - 1.8v) / 0.015A
#R = 3.2v / 0.015A
#R = 213.333 Ohms

#It is therefore recommended to use 220R resistors when using 5v GPIO.

#If any of your values differ by setup (GPIO voltage) or display (forward voltage / current tolerance)
#simply plug those values into the equation and work out the appropriate resistance needed.
#A general rule is to use 75% of the current tolerance of the display for the best trade off
#between segment brightness and LED lifespan.

#If the required resistance is between values of resistor, it is advisable to use the higher value
#at the cost of brightness in order to extend the life of the display. Resistors of smaller values can be
#connected in series to make up the value. eg 100R and 220R in series would give 320R resistance overall.
